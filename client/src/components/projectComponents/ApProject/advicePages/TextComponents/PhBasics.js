          <p>  Different fish enjoy different pH ranges.<br/>
            A balance must be struck between the needs of the fish, the nitrifying bacteria and the needs of the plants
            in the system.<br/>
            Water with a higher temperature will give lower pH readings (more acidic) so one way of maintaining stable pH
            ranges is by keeping your temperature stable. <br/>
            pH also affects the amount of toxic ammonia in the system. <br/>
            At pH 7.0 or below, most ammonia (>95%) will be in the non-toxic form (NH4+).<br/>
            A good rule of thumb is to aim for a neutral 7 pH and avoid fluctuations of over 1 pH. <br/>
            Gentle fluctuations in pH are good for your system and are natural. <br/>
            If considering modifying the pH yourself please do so slowly and read the section carefully.<br/>
