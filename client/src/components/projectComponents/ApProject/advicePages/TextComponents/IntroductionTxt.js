            <p>“ Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (the soil-less growing of plants) that grows fish and plants together in one integrated system.<br/>
                The fish waste provides an organic food source for the plants, and the plants naturally filter the water for the fish. <br/>
                The third participants are microbes (nitrifying bacteria). <br/>
                These bacteria convert ammonia from the fish waste… into nitrates. <br/>
                Nitrates…  that plants can uptake and use to grow. <br/>
                Solid fish waste is turned into vermicomposting that also acts as food for the plants.”<br/>
