            <p>High ammonia can be caused by over feeding, over stocking,
                high pH, high temperatures, leftover food or organic material and bacterial colony deaths.</p>

              <strong><h5>Checklist:</h5></strong><br/>
              <ul>
              <li>
                  <p>Check your nitrite levels in your system to see if the ammonia is being converted into nitrogen.</p>
              </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>Check system for leftover food, organic material.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>Use a fine mesh net to remove any left over debris in the tank and in the garden beds.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>Clean any solids removal mechanisms.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>Reduce feeding.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>Check and stabilize pH and temperature to lower levels, read the sections in this document.</p>
                  </li>
              </ul>
                  <p>If you have consistent spikes in ammonia TAN you might consider reducing stock,
                      increasing grow-bed space, adding solids removal and/or bio-filters.
                  </p>

                <p>In extreme cases where your fish are showing signs of stress you may need to do a gradual water change.
                Caution must be taken not to shock the fish in the system.
                    See the section on system resetting. </p>
