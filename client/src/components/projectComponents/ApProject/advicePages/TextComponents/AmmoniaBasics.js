            <p>Ammonia and its cycle into nitrogen are the key drivers of the aquaponics system.<br/>
                Bacteria break down ammonia from fish waste and leftover food into nitrogen that your plants need for survival.<br/>
                Ammonia comes in two forms Nh4+, which is usually not toxic at concentrations found in aquaponics and Nh3 which can cause stress to your fish at levels as low as .25 parts per million (ppm or mg/L).<br/>
                Both of these measured together is referred to as total ammonia nitrogen or TAN.<br/>

                At higher temperatures and higher pH Nh4+ is converted into Nh3 therefore, do your best to manage these first. However, it is best to keep the TAN low in case of spikes in temperature and pH. At pH 7.0 or below, most ammonia (>95%) will be in the non-toxic form (NH4+).</p>
