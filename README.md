Settled on the tools - Lets build

So after much experimentation with the stack. I have settled on the following:

REACT

EXPRESS

MYSQL

react-strap & react-bootstrap (be careful these are sometimes used in the same components)

PLUS: Other packages as in the package.json files.

ARCHITECTURE is mostly settled.

My main focus for now is: 

Learning to debug in this stack.

Learning to build an application in this stack, Mostly focusing on front end, React (for now) but having the back ready.

Async programming.

# 'npm run dev'  - Be sure to start the mysql DB
- This might be causing proxy errors

From the root dir or check the package.json files for more options.

Yeah that's about it for now!
